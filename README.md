# Legacysite


## What is this project
This project aims to restore the old 7Zeb Website before the NewUI CSS Framework, yup back when the site looked like a 2000s/90s webpage.

There are actually 3 different options you have.

index.html will take you to how the site looked in April 2025.

90s.html will take you to how the site looked in December 2024.

last.html will take you to the last version of the site before the NewUI CSS Framework

Other pages like the updates have also been ported over!
